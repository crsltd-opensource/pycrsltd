This is the central library for the python interface to CRS Ltd hardware (Bits++,
ColorCal etc...).

The library is very much under construction and should not be used yet except by
enthusiasts. 

It is being written mostly by Jon Peirce, with support from CRS Ltd. If you would
like to contribute please get in touch!

Assuming you have python and setuptools installed already, you can install the package with the command:

    easy_install pycrsltd
